# Curs.

Hyper HTTP client lib, feels more like curl. Supports file Uploads.

It feels like curl,
this HTTP client,
it's built on Hyper,
shoulder of a giant.

Lets you post files,
which is a good start,
it adds its own headers,
makes it multipart.

Decodes Response JSON,
it's good for your REST,
go check some examples,
they're all inside /test.

The code is quite simple,  
and easy to digest,
